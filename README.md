# DistributedCommerce

A modern, cloud-native e-commerce platform built with microservices architecture, designed for scalability, resilience, and high performance. This project demonstrates enterprise-grade patterns and practices for building distributed systems using .NET and Kubernetes.

## üöÄ Overview

DistributedCommerce is a fully-featured e-commerce platform that breaks down traditional monolithic architecture into discrete, independently deployable microservices. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability, enabling teams to develop, deploy, and scale features independently.

### Why Microservices?

This architecture was chosen to provide:

- **Scalability** - Scale individual services based on demand rather than the entire application
- **Resilience** - Fault isolation ensures one failing service doesn't bring down the entire system
- **Technology Flexibility** - Choose the best technology stack for each service's specific needs
- **Team Autonomy** - Teams can work independently on different services without stepping on each other's toes
- **Faster Deployment** - Deploy updates to individual services without redeploying everything

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The platform is built following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and Clean Architecture patterns. Each microservice is structured with clear boundaries and responsibilities.

### Services

The platform consists of 8 core microservices:

#### 1. **Identity Service**
Handles user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens. Manages user accounts, roles, and permissions across the platform.

#### 2. **Catalog Service**
Manages product catalog, including product information, categories, pricing, and product search functionality. This is the heart of product discovery.

#### 3. **Order Service**
Orchestrates the order lifecycle from creation to completion. Implements the Saga pattern for distributed transactions across multiple services.

#### 4. **Payment Service**
Processes payments securely, handles payment gateway integration, and manages transaction records. Implements idempotency to prevent duplicate charges.

#### 5. **Inventory Service**
Tracks stock levels, manages warehouse inventory, and handles stock reservations. Ensures products can't be oversold through real-time inventory management.

#### 6. **Shipping Service**
Manages shipping logistics, calculates shipping costs, tracks deliveries, and integrates with shipping providers.

#### 7. **Notification Service**
Sends transactional notifications via email, SMS, and push notifications. Handles order confirmations, shipping updates, and promotional messages.

#### 8. **Analytics Service**
Collects and processes business metrics, generates reports, and provides insights into customer behavior and business performance.

### Building Blocks

The platform leverages shared building blocks to ensure consistency across services:

- **Domain** - Common domain models, value objects, and domain events
- **Application** - CQRS, MediatR handlers, and application services
- **Infrastructure** - Database access, caching, and external integrations
- **EventBus** - Asynchronous messaging using RabbitMQ for inter-service communication
- **Authentication** - Shared JWT authentication and authorization logic
- **Observability** - Distributed tracing, metrics, and logging with OpenTelemetry
- **Resilience** - Circuit breakers, retries, and fallback policies using Polly
- **Saga** - Distributed transaction orchestration for complex workflows
- **Idempotency** - Ensures operations can be safely retried without side effects

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

The fastest way to get the entire platform running locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DistributedCommerce.git
cd DistributedCommerce

# Start all services with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Check service health
docker-compose ps
```

The services will be available at:
- Identity API: http://localhost:5001
- Catalog API: http://localhost:5002
- Order API: http://localhost:5003

- Inventory API: http://localhost:5005
- Shipping API: http://localhost:5006
- Notification API: http://localhost:5007
- Analytics API: http://localhost:5008

### Running Services Individually

If you prefer to run services separately:

```bash
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run a specific service (example: Catalog API)
cd src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.API
dotnet run
```

### Database Setup

Each service manages its own database. Migrations are applied automatically on startup in development mode.

To manually apply migrations:

```bash
# Example for Catalog Service
cd src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.Infrastructure
dotnet ef database update
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run unit tests only
dotnet test --filter Category=Unit

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Distributed Tracing

All services are instrumented with OpenTelemetry to provide end-to-end request tracing:

- View traces in Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686
- Track request flow across services
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Debug distributed transactions

### Metrics

Key metrics are collected and visualized in Grafana:

- Request rate, latency, and error rate (RED metrics)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
- Business metrics (orders placed, revenue, inventory levels)
- Database performance metrics

### Logging

Structured logging is implemented across all services:

- Logs are collected by the OpenTelemetry Collector
- View logs in Seq at http://localhost:5341
- Correlated with traces using correlation IDs
- Search and filter across all services

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Each service can be configured via environment variables or `appsettings.json`:

```bash
# Database connection
ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="Host=localhost;Database=catalog;Username=postgres;Password=postgres"

# RabbitMQ
EventBus__Connection="amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672"

# Redis
Redis__Configuration="localhost:6379"

# OpenTelemetry
OpenTelemetry__ServiceName="catalog-api"
OpenTelemetry__OtlpEndpoint="http://localhost:4317"
```

### Service Configuration Files

Configuration is managed at multiple levels:

- `appsettings.json` - Default configuration
- `appsettings.Development.json` - Development overrides
- `appsettings.Production.json` - Production settings
- Environment variables - Runtime overrides
- Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets - K8s deployments

## üîê Security

### Authentication & Authorization
